# Ecstasy

Sparse-set based ECS for Unity. Simple, flexible and fast.

Core part of architecture that I'm developing for all our future games, **of any scale**.

## Features
* Burst + Jobs direct support
* Stupendously simple architecture
* As simple as for-loop iteration
* Data is tightly packed, contiguously per-type
* No Sync-Points, No Events, No Bitmasks, Barebones!
* Works with any data types
* Total control and freedom

### Work-in-progress
* Struct Interfaces support via InterfacePool

Can be used outside of Unity, with a slight modification.

## Examples

## Motivation? Why yet another ECS!
Every existing implementation I've seen is utterly overcomplicated, heavy, hard to understand and work with.

Unity's ECS is based on the most difficult architecture — Archetypes.\
The learning barrier is **colossal**, with tons of pitfalls, and so many core game features missing and never released.\
It just doesn't suit ***existing*** Unity Ecosystem (unless remade as a brand-new DOTS engine).

We, instead, simply use **Sparse-sets** for iterating over contiguous data array:\

It fits perfectly within Unity, works with any components and familiar workflows.

Our refreshing approach might unlock a true game-design potential, with endless amount of new opportunities — technical and gameplay-wise. The ideas that I've never thought of before, now ~ flow to me naturally. It is a joy to program with :)

\**being too ecstatic*\*

Still, I need to proof this concept on a real project and find all the downfalls of this implementation, as there is no one-fit silver bullet!

## Notice
During development of `Open Labs Core` systems, this tool won't be shipped as a UPM package.\
Use it as a pluggable asset, and modify it for your project needs.\
Get .unitypackage on Releases page.\
Pull Requests, Ideas and Discussions are very welcomed!

## Usage & Quirks
Components are refered to as **Data**

```csharp
var world = World.Default;
     
// Get the required data pools:
var gravityPool = world.Pool<CustomGravity>();
// Loop over smallest pool when querying for multiple types
var (trsPool, bodyPool) = world.Pool<TRS, SimpleRigidbody>(out var smallestPool);

// foreach (var ID in smallestPool)
for (int i = 0; i < smallestPool.count; i++) 
{ 
    var id = smallestPool.GetEntityID(i);
    ref var trs = ref trsPool[id]; // get by ref!
    // ...
}
```
```csharp
var entity = world.CreateEntity(); // or world.GetEntity(gameObject)
world.AddData(entity, new TRS(transform), new SimpleRigidbody());
```

You can optionally use `ushorts` for IDs with `ENTITY_SHORT_ID` define,\
We use 0 value instead of -1 for unassigned entities, thus - the [0] data slot is reserved to null entity.

Use `GameObjectEntity` to auto-link attached MonoBehaviours:\

Optional: inherit from `SystemBehaviour` and attach it on game-object. It'll use a coroutine update loop.

## What's Next?
Make actual games with it.\
I'm extremely interested in researching complex logic and deep behaviour systems — \
Emergent & engaging AI, bosses, game flow, world interactions, dynamic soundscape, \
Characters ala Mario Odyssey, Zelda BOTW, Sekiro, Jak, It Takes Two.. just to name a few :)

So yeah, I'm eagering to make a 3D Platformer now.\
I will be sharing the progress on [our discord channel](https://discord.gg/NrX5TCJ4aq).

## Research (**help wanted!**)
We need to design a struct-based, ***visual data-oriented*** \
"State Machine/Behaviour Tree/HTN/GOAP/Planner/**Flow Graph**" hybrid that works with **Jobs**!

The idea is to separate Design from Code, provide visual debugging and runtime graph editing (in Editor and Player builds!).\
In the same fashion as Ecstasy — simple stupid and powerful.

## TODO
* Test interfaces in Jobs
* Implement Entity **Versioning?** (**!**)
* Support scenes loading
* More Examples & Showcases

## Roadmap
* Entity Debugger
* Runtime Debugging in Build
* Any-Data Authoring in Inspector
* Multiple Worlds + Serialization

## Futures Future
* Battle-test in real world production
* Streamable Game Worlds
* Data & Commands Journaling
* Networking via Unity Transport Layer (a secret prototype!)
* Determenistic Simulation Rollback & Replays (ala Overwatch)
